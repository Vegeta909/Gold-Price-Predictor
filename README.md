# Gold Price Predictor

## 📌 Overview
The **Gold Price Predictor** is a machine learning project that predicts gold prices based on historical data from **2008 to 2018**. It leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to provide accurate price predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of historical gold price data spanning from **2008 to 2018**.
- The primary file used:
  - **gold_price.csv**: Contains historical gold price data with relevant features.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-Learn**

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and normalizes data for better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies trends and patterns in historical gold price data.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements predictive modeling to forecast future gold prices.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Uses R² score, MAE, and RMSE to assess model accuracy.

## 📊 Results
- The model was fine-tuned using various performance metrics.
- Achieved improved accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
